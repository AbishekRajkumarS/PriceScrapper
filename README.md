## Abstract

### Problem Faced

> When a customer goes to a E-Commerce website, he/she always face trouble in choosing which website to use for buying a certain product. People waste a lot of their precious time in deciding which website to choose from, and at a point of time the customer gets fed up and leaves the websites, without buying any product from any of the websites. Which results in loss for the E-Commerce website, because each customer is precious for the company!!!

### My Solution

> I'll be scrappinig two websites and will create a Restful Api, with the data that I've gained. I'll then be analysing the data I've gained and return the best product from the two different websites. The Api will also return a graph of the result with respect to the rating and cost prices(I'll do this if time permits).

***The main task performmed are as follows:***
  - A Spider crawls the website.
  - Obtained data is stored as CSV file.
  - The data is then analysed.
  - When request hits the API, a JSON respones is returned.
  - The API response consists of:
     - The best price
     - A graph of various items.

***The modules that are used:***
  - Scrappy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
